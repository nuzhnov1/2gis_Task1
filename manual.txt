NAME
    tsp - Solves the travelling salesman's problem(tsp) with various algorithms.

SYNOPSIS
    tsp [-f <file with data>] [-m <np_complete | np_partial>] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
    Solves the traveling salesman problem in two ways: by a complete search of
    all possible combinations and by a heuristic algorithm.
    The numbering of vertices starts from 1.

OPTIONS
    -f
        Extracts the distance matrix from the specified file.

    -m
        Solves this task by specified method:
        
        np_complete - complete search of all possible Hamiltonian
        cycles(brute force method). Complexity - O((n - 1)! / 2).
        
        np_partial - heuristic algorithm. This option used nearest neighbour
        algorithm. Complexity - O(n^2).

        Default value of this parameter - np_complete.
    
    -h
        Prints this manual.
